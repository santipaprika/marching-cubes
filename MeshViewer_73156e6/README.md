# MeshViewer

A generic viewer for subjects focusing on (triangle) mesh algorithms.

The viewer is based on [Qt](https://qt.io). It provides full functionality to navigate the model(s) and it is easy to add new features.

The provided mesh-module is intended as initial sample on which students may build their projects and is based on [OpenMesh](https://openmesh.org). It should be easy to build alternative modules for other choices
of representations, or to add new mesh ops.

This code has been developed with Qt version 5.10 and OpenMesh version 8.0, but its use of these libraries is fairly basic, and you may be able to build it with previous versions as well.
